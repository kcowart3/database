            It is easy to think of the kitchen and dining room as the stomach or digestive system of the house, though this comparison is tenuous. A contrast: the  kitchen and dining room are the heart of the house, the center of activity and socialization. The hallways and corridors of a house are its veins, providing circulation coursing throughout its frame. A staircase bears more than a passing resemblance both physically and symbolically to a spine. The windows serve much the same purpose as eyes, and anyone who has rounded a bend or long drive and come suddenly face to face with a tall, dark manor will tell you that it is difficult to shake the impression that the house, through its lightless windows, is a creature capable of vision and intelligence.
