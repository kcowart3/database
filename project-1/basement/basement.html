            And yet this analogy is an incomplete one. Obviously the mind is an exceedingly complex thing, but the bedroom represents the thinking, dreaming part of the brain and it is the basement that represents those lower, unconscious parts. The basement is dark, it is buried. It is a place full of cobwebs where memories are stored. A point of comparison, truly. Often the unnerving uncertainty that comes with considering the deeper aspects of the human psyche is not unlike gazing down at the swimming blackness pooled at the bottom of the basement stairwell. It is a place we spend our childhoods filling with monsters that will lay for years in patient silence. It is a place that, barring some specific errand, we seldom ever want to go.

            Of course this comparison, though appropriate, is a very heavy-handed one. Often the basement  is little more than a storage space, littered with the corpses of spiders and woodlice. While poets and psychoanalysts no doubt dread the thought of a dark basement, in truth it is the bedroom, the waking mind, that place of dreams, which is actually the most frightening of all.
